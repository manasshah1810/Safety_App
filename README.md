<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>We have developed a <b>safety-focused app</b> that empowers users to report, track, and verify safety incidents in real-time. The app leverages crowdsourced data, historical trends, and community feedback to provide users with a comprehensive view of safety in various locations. It enables users to make informed decisions by visualizing incident data on dynamic heatmaps, offering route safety scores, and presenting safety trends. Users can also contribute to the app by verifying reported incidents and providing valuable feedback on specific areas, making this a collaborative safety tool for communities.</p>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Crowdsourced Incident Reporting:</b>

Real-time reporting of safety incidents, including theft, accidents, harassment, and more.
Users can categorize incidents and upload photos or videos for better documentation.</li>
<li><b>Safety Heatmap:</b>

A dynamic, color-coded map displaying safety ratings of different areas.
Data is visualized based on user reports, historical information, and the time of day to highlight high-risk and safe zones.</li>
<li><b>Route Safety Score:</b>

Provides safety ratings for various travel routes (walking, driving, public transit).
Offers route recommendations based on incident data and sends alerts when users are near recently reported unsafe areas.</li>
<li><b>Incident History & Trends:</b>

Displays historical data on safety incidents to track trends over time in specific neighborhoods.
Users can view common types of incidents, such as vehicle theft or pickpocketing, to assess safety risks in different areas.</li>
<li><b>Community Verification & Feedback:</b>

Users can verify and validate reported incidents by adding comments or voting on their accuracy.
Provides community feedback on the safety of specific locations, such as lighting conditions, police presence, or crowdedness.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How It Works</h3>
<ul>
<li>Report Incidents: Users can log incidents in real-time and upload supporting media (photos/videos) to help the community stay informed.</li>
<li>Check Safety Heatmaps: The heatmap provides an immediate visual representation of safety conditions in various areas.</li>
<li>Review Safety Scores: Route safety scores guide users through the safest travel options, avoiding high-risk areas.</li>
<li>Analyze Trends: Users can access historical data to understand safety trends in their local neighborhoods.</li>
<li>Verify and Provide Feedback: Community members can contribute by verifying incident reports and offering feedback on location safety.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Contributing</h3>
<p>The app fosters a collaborative community effort, encouraging users to contribute to the accuracy and validity of reported data. Your participation will help make the app a trusted resource for users in making safer decisions.</p>
